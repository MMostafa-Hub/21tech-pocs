# Service Manuals to Troubleshooting Guides (task plans/check lists)

# Use Case: Leveraging LLMs to Transform Equipment Manuals into Standardized Work Orders

A maintenance manager faces the challenge of creating consistent, detailed work orders for equipment troubleshooting. Currently, technicians must manually search through lengthy service manuals to find proper procedures, leading to inconsistent work quality, missed steps, and inefficient use of time. This use case demonstrates how Large Language Models can transform this process.

## The Challenge

When a critical piece of manufacturing equipment malfunctions, maintenance technicians often spend valuable time searching through hundreds of pages of technical documentation to identify the proper troubleshooting steps. This manual process leads to:

1. **Inconsistent work quality,** as different technicians may interpret manual instructions differently
2. **Missed safety procedures** that could lead to workplace injuries
3. **Extended equipment downtime** due to time spent researching proper procedures
4. **Lack of standardization** across similar maintenance tasks

## LLM-Powered Solution

### Data Extraction Phase

The maintenance manager implements an LLM-based system that:

1. **Ingests technical documentation** by processing the equipment's service manuals, technical bulletins, and historical repair logs.
2. **Identifies key maintenance procedures** by recognizing structured patterns in the documentation that indicate troubleshooting steps, safety requirements, and required tools.
3. **Extracts contextual relationships** between symptoms, causes, and resolution steps to create logical troubleshooting flows.
4. **Recognizes safety-critical information** by identifying warnings, cautions, and required personal protective equipment specifications.

### Structured Work Order Creation Phase

The LLM then automatically:

1. **Generates standardized task plans** organized in a step-by-step format that follows the company's work order template.
2. **Creates detailed checklists** including:
    - Required tools and parts
    - Safety procedures and PPE requirements
    - Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions
    - Expected completion timeframes
    - Verification steps to ensure proper repair
3. **Prioritizes tasks** based on safety considerations, logical sequence, and efficiency.
4. **Incorporates equipment-specific details** such as model numbers, asset IDs, and location information.

## Benefits

This LLM integration delivers significant advantages:

1. **Improved consistency** - Every technician follows the same standardized procedures, reducing variation in work quality.
2. **Enhanced safety compliance** - Critical safety procedures are automatically included in every relevant work order.
3. **Reduced equipment downtime** - Technicians spend less time researching procedures and more time performing actual maintenance.
4. **Knowledge preservation** - Expertise from manuals is captured in standardized formats that persist even as experienced technicians retire.
5. **Continuous improvement** - The system can incorporate feedback from completed work orders to refine future task plans.
