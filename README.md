# 21Tech AI-Powered EAM Assistants (POCS)

This repository contains a collection of Proof-of-Concept (POC) applications built with Django and leveraging AI to enhance and automate processes within the HxGN EAM system.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a Django backend that serves as an "AI Development" platform. It integrates with HxGN EAM via its web services API and utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series, along with document parsing engines, to provide intelligent assistance for various maintenance and asset management tasks.
