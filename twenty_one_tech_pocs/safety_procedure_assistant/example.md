### **1. Description of Incident:**

At approximately 2:45 PM on May 22, 2025, Ahmed Saleh, a certified forklift operator, was operating a Toyota 8FGCU25 LPG-powered forklift equipped with a dual-stage mast and side-shift attachment. He was transporting a pallet of metal automotive components (total weight \~500 kg) from Receiving to the Assembly Area.

While turning the corner at Section B in Warehouse 4, Ahmed misjudged the clearance between the turning radius and a shelving rack system (Model: MECO Pallet Rack 42" D x 12' H). This system was recently restocked with oversized industrial fittings stacked above the recommended shelf limit. The shelving unit had previously been flagged for inspection due to noticeable tilt, which was not addressed.

Upon collision, the left side of the forklift’s overhead guard struck the lower portion of the shelving rack, destabilizing the top two tiers. Several unsecured metal fittings (each \~15 kg) fell from the top shelf. One of these components struck Ahmed's left shoulder while he remained seated in the forklift. Due to the impact, the forklift’s emergency brake was engaged automatically.

Co-workers heard the noise and rushed to the site. Ahmed was conscious but reported acute pain and limited arm mobility. Onsite first responders from the safety team used a portable trauma kit to stabilize the injury before emergency medical services arrived.

### **2. Injuries Sustained:**

* Suspected fracture and contusion to the left shoulder (humerus/scapula region)
* Superficial abrasions on left forearm and hand due to sharp contact with falling debris
* Elevated stress response and minor shock symptoms (dizziness, pale complexion)

Ahmed was transported to Cairo General Hospital where initial imaging (X-ray and CT) confirmed a proximal humeral fracture. He is currently in orthopedic care with a recovery prognosis of 6–8 weeks.

### **3. Witnesses:**

* Sara Kamal, Line Supervisor (direct witness from \~5 meters away)
* Hossam Youssef, Logistics Coordinator (arrived \~30 seconds after incident)
* Nada El Mahdy, Quality Assurance Intern (reviewed prior shelf inspection log)

### **4. Immediate Actions Taken:**

* Isolated Section B and halted all forklift traffic pending investigation
* Deactivated the compromised shelving rack and secured surrounding area with safety barriers
* Collected initial witness statements and reviewed CCTV footage
* Checked forklift logbook and verified recent maintenance (last serviced May 10, 2025)

### **5. Root Cause Analysis:**

The primary cause was an infrastructural failure due to improper pallet rack loading practices and lack of corrective follow-up from a previously logged inspection warning. Secondary causation includes operator misjudgment due to limited visibility and inadequate spatial indicators around corners.

### **6. Contributing Factors:**

* Absence of high-visibility reflective floor markings and overhead warning signage
* Missing corner-mounted convex mirrors for blind spot navigation
* Overloaded shelving units beyond design weight limit (by approx. 15%)
* Lack of real-time monitoring for rack load compliance

### **7. Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA):**

* Immediate re-inspection and re-certification of all pallet racks (due by May 31, 2025)
* Installation of high-visibility corner indicators and convex safety mirrors by June 10, 2025
* Procurement of a digital shelf-load monitoring system for all storage units
* Mandatory forklift spatial awareness retraining program for all drivers (to be completed by June 15, 2025)
* Revision and strict enforcement of material stacking protocols

### **8. Pieces of Equipment Involved:**

* Toyota Forklift Model 8FGCU25 (Serial #FGCU25123456)
* MECO Pallet Rack System (12' high, steel alloy)
* Palletized load of 500 kg metal fittings (batch #IND-COM-2205)
* Standard trauma response kit from Safety Locker #2
* In-house CCTV System (Camera ID WH4-B07)

### **9. Attachments:**

* Photographs from incident scene (before and after shelf collapse)
* Forklift maintenance and usage logs
* Shelf unit inspection records and deviation logs
* Ahmed Saleh's hospital intake and imaging report
* CCTV footage screenshot sequence (pending approval)

### **10. Follow-Up Required:**

* Daily updates on Ahmed Saleh’s medical status during recovery period
* Compliance verification of corrective actions by Safety Committee
* Full safety briefing session scheduled with warehouse staff for June 5, 2025
* Final audit report on incident due by July 5, 2025
